                  Upon sending an instruction of using Cryptol Services for Crypto-to-crypto

                  the open Orders, and your Orders will be included in Cryptol’s order book to
                  match other users’ Orders. If one of your Orders fully or partially matches
                  another user’s Order, Cryptol will execute an exchange (a “Transaction”).
                  Once the Transaction is executed, your account will be updated to reflect
                  that the Order has been fully executed and closed, or the Order has been
                  partially executed. The Order will remain uncompleted until it is fully
                  executed or cancelled under paragraph (b) below. To conclude a Transaction,
                  you authorize Cryptol to temporarily control the Digital Currencies involved

                  For Orders initiated through Cryptol Services, you may only cancel them
                  before they have been matched with other Users’ Orders. Once your Order has
                  been matched with another user’s Order, you may not change, revoke or cancel
                  Cryptol’s authorization to complete the Order. For any partially matched
                  Order, you may cancel the unmatched part of the Order unless such portion
                  has been matched. Cryptol reserves the right to reject any cancellation
                  request related to the Order you have submitted. If your account does not
                  have sufficient amount of Digital Currencies to execute an Order, Cryptol
                  may cancel the entire Order, or execute part of the Order with the amount of
                  Digital Currencies you have in your account (in each case, any Transaction

                <div class="css-wgpe91">
                  Margins Trading is highly risky. As a leveraged trader, you acknowledge and
                  agree that you access and use Margins Trading and borrowing services at your
                  own risk, which include but are not limited to:
                  <ol>
                    <li class="cornerMarginTop">
                      The liquidity, market depth and dynamics of the trading market fluctuate
                      violently and change rapidly. The use of leverage may work to your
                      advantage or disadvantage, which may result in major gains or losses as
                      the case may be.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You are not eligible to receive forked currencies split from any
                      blockchain assets in your Collateral Account, even if you have not
                      engaged in any Margins Trading or borrowing at all.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Loans carry risk, and the value of your blockchain assets may decline.
                      If the value of your assets drops to a certain level, you are
                      responsible for dealing with these market circumstances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In some market situations, you may find it difficult or impossible to
                      liquidate a position. This may occur, for example, as a result of
                      insufficient market liquidity or technical issues on Cryptol.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Placing contingent Orders does not necessarily limit your losses to the
                      expected amount, as market conditions may prevent you from executing
                      such orders.

                    <li>
                      Margins Trading does not have guaranteed measures against losses. As a
                      borrower, you may suffer losses that exceed the amount you deposited
                      into your Collateral Account.

                  resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute
                  with Cryptol, then you should contact Cryptol and a ticket number will be
                  assigned. Cryptol will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as
                  possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the
                  dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to
                  applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in
                  any legal proceeding).<br /><br />In the event the dispute cannot be
                  resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against
                  Cryptol, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a
                  “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Cryptol. The Notice of Claim
                  must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set
                  forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the original ticket number,

                  submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence
                  with Cryptol. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to Cryptol, the

                  arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                  essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any,
                  are based. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING

                  The failure of one party to require performance of any provision will not
                  affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter. At
                  the same time, the waiver of one party to seek recovery for the other
                  party’s violation of these Terms or any provision of applicable terms shall
                  not constitute a waiver by that party of any subsequent breach or violation
                  by the other party or of the provision itself.
